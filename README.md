# DSA-organizer
This Chrome extension helps organize your LeetCode questions by DSA topics for easy revision. It automatically fetches the current pageâ€™s LeetCode question URL and categorizes it under the appropriate topic. Questions are stored locally for future use, allowing you to add, delete, and review them whenever needed.
