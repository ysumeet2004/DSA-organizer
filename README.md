# LeetCode DSA Question Organizer Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension helps you organize your LeetCode questions based on various DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) topics for easy revision. It automatically fetches the current pageâ€™s LeetCode question URL and stores it under the appropriate DSA topic. Questions are stored locally for future use, allowing you to add, delete, and review them whenever needed.

## Features:
- **Automatic Link Detection**: The extension fetches the current page's title and URL from LeetCode and stores it under the selected DSA topic.
- **Categorization**: Organize questions by DSA topics such as Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, and more.
- **Persistent Data**: Data is stored locally in Chrome's storage, ensuring it remains available across browser sessions.
- **Add/Delete Questions**: Add questions using the `+` button, or delete them from any topic.
- **Tab-based Organization**: Organize your questions under the **Create Sheet**, **Revision**, and **Misc** tabs.
